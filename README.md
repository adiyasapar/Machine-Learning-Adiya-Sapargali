# Mushroom Classification using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project presents an analysis of decision tree and random forest classifiers for binary classification using the Mushroom dataset. Several machine learning algorithms were implemented from scratch, including decision trees with different splitting criteria (Gini impurity, entropy, and classification error), and random forests using bagging. The models were evaluated based on test accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and the impact of hyperparameter settings.
